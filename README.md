# Subthreshold-Cross-Coupled-Hybrid-Charge-Pump-
Designed a subthreshold hybrid cross-coupled charge pump capable of cold-starting from 50 mV for energy-harvesting applications, achieving >76% efficiency and 25× faster settling time.

Abstract: A 180nm CMOS technology-based project presents a fully integrated switched-capacitor DC-DC converter based on the Dickson charge pump, designed to operate efficiently even when the input voltage is so low that the transistors work in the subthreshold region. To address the limitations faced by conventional charge pump designs in such low-voltage conditions, our architecture incorporates resistors in charge transfer switches. This modification helps to ensure reliable operation and improved performance in the subthreshold regime.
